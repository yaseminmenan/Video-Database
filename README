In this assignment I implemented a video database that provides information
about movies, series, actors, and users.

The project receives all that information as an input, as well as a list of
actions that need to be executed. There are three types of actions: commands,
queries and recommendations. After the input is received, the program traverses
through the action list and performs the required actions.

The classes for the action types are found in the package actions, and each
action has its own package.

Command
The command action has three different types: favorite, view, and rating. All
types of commands are found in the command package.

Query
The query action has four object types: actors, movies, shows, users. Each
object type has its own class. Movies and shows share the same queries. I have
created an abstract class QueryVideos that includes the Favorite and Most 
Viewed methods in order to avoid duplicated code.

Each video query returns a list with a number of videos specified in the input,
sorted in a given order. If that number exceeds the number of videos in the 
database, the list returns all the videos which meet the requirements.

Recommend
The recommend action returns a video, or multiple videos, depending on the
given strategy. There are two strategies for all subscription types (Standard,
Best unseen), and three strategies only for premium subscriptions (Popular,
Favorite, Search). All strategies are found in the recommendation package.

All strategies return the video according to the database 
order, with the exception of the Search recommendation, which sorts the videos
alphabetically. 

Additional modifications:
- added constants for index values in Constants class;
- added class MapMethods in common package to avoid duplicate code;
- added to Season class the userRatings map, getUserRatings, calculateAverage
methods;
- added to Input class the getMovie, getSerial, getUser methods;
- added to MovieInputData class the movieRatings map and the addToMovieRatings,
getMovieRatings, calculateAverage methods;
- added to SerialInputData the setRating, getSeason methods;
- added to ShowInput class the checkVideoFilters method.
